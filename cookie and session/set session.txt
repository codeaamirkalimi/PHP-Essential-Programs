A session creates a file in a temporary directory on the server where registered session variables and their values are stored.
This data will be available to all pages on the site during that visit.

The location of the temporary file is determined by a setting in the php.ini file called session.save_path.
Before using any session variable make sure you have setup this path.

When a session is started following things happen âˆ’

           PHP first creates a unique identifier for that particular session which is a random string of 32 hexadecimal numbers such as 3c7foj34c3jj973hjkop2fc937e3443.
           A cookie called PHPSESSID is automatically sent to the user's computer to store unique session identification string.
           A file is automatically created on the server in the designated temporary directory and bears the name of the unique identifier prefixed by sess_ ie sess_3c7foj34c3jj973hjkop2fc937e3443.
