PHP must be configured correctly in the php.ini file with the details of how your system sends email.
Open php.ini file  and find the section headed [mail function].

Windows users should ensure that two directives are supplied.
The first is called SMTP that defines your email server address.
The second is called sendmail_from which defines your own email address.

Linux users simply need to let PHP know the location of their sendmail application.
The path and any desired switches should be specified to the sendmail_path directive.

PHP makes use of mail() function to send an email.
This function requires three mandatory arguments that specify the recipient's email address,
the subject of the the message and the actual message additionally there are other two optional parameters.

             mail(to,subject,message,headers,parameters);

   Parameters	                              Description

  to-Required              Specifies the receiver / receivers of the email
 subject-Required          Specifies the subject of the email. Note: This parameter cannot contain any newline characters
 message-Required          Defines the message to be sent. Each line should be separated with a LF (\n).
                           Lines should not exceed 70 characters.
                          Windows note: If a full stop is found on the beginning of a line in the message,
						  it might be removed. To solve this problem, replace the full stop with a double dot:
                         <?php
                         $txt = str_replace("\n.", "\n..", $txt);
                         ?>

 headers-Optional         Specifies additional headers, like From, Cc, and Bcc.
                          The additional headers should be separated with a CRLF (\r\n).
                          Note: When sending an email, it must contain a From header.
						  This can be set with this parameter or in the php.ini file.

  parameters-Optional     Specifies an additional parameter to the sendmail program (the one defined in the sendmail_path
                          configuration setting). (i.e. this can be used to set the envelope sender address when using
   						  sendmail with the -f sendmail option)
